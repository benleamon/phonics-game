# Phonics Game
I made this simple phonics game for the students in my class, and more broadly anyone looking to learn some basic English phonics. 

## Rights
The phonics cards used on this site were made by Andrew Cletheroe, and he retains the rights to the cards. The sound recordings were made by me. Please contact me if you'd like to use them in a different project. 

## Procedure for Adding Cards
1. Move new images into the image-staging folder. Run image-sizer.sh
2. Move the images in image-staging to full-res-images to retain. 
3. Run file-lister.sh.
